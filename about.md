Hi, I'm Sam. I'm a programmer living in Bristol. In October I'll be starting a PhD in environmental research.

The cover image is a photo taken from a helium balloon some friends and I launched, at an altitude of about 32km. Check out the [Bristol SEDS website](http://bristol-seds.co.uk) for more information.
