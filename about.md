![Me]({{site.url}}/public/images/me.jpg)

I am a scientist at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://ecmwf.int)) in Reading, UK. I was previously a DPhil (i.e. PhD) student in the Predictability of Weather and Climate Group, Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics at the University of Oxford, where I graduated in 2019. My DPhil research focused on ways to improve the computational effiency of weather and climate simulators through reduced-precision arithmetic. I am now putting these ideas into practice at ECMWF in order to improve their operational numerical weather prediction system.

I am also interested in science communication, specifically the topics of energy, climate change and weather prediction. To this end, I built a [mini weather-simulating supercomputer](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/science-blog/2019/weather-forecasts-openifs-home-made-supercomputer) and also entered the Famelab UK competition, where [I came second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5rKxSoiO5Q&t=2735s). If you'd like me to present on any of the above topics, or on science communication more generally, please get in touch at `sh0799<at>my.bristol.ac.uk`!
