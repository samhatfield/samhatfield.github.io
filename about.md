![Me]({{site.url}}/public/images/me.jpg)

I'm Sam, a DPhil (i.e. PhD) student in the Predictability of Weather and Climate Group, Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics at the University of Oxford. I previously studied for an MSci in Physics at the University of Bristol.

My interests lie in the intersection of numerical weather prediction, data assimilation and high performance computing. I am interested in finding ways to exploit our knowledge of atmospheric dynamics in order to improve the efficiency of our high performance simulation systems. I am also passionate about building transparent, efficient and readable code to aid the reproducibility of computational science experiments.

I'm supervised by [Tim Palmer](https://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-tim-palmer) at Oxford and [Peter DÃ¼ben](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/who-we-are/staff-profiles/peter-dueben) at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. I am a member of the [Jesus College](https://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/) Middle Common Room, where I was Treasurer from 2017-2018.
