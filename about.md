Hi, I'm Sam. I'm a graduate student studying Environmental Research at the University of Oxford.
Here are some facts about me:

- I have a physics degree from the University of Bristol.
- I worked for a year as a programmer for a company called [Microcosm](http://microcosm.co.uk/), in Bristol.
- In 2014, I helped with designing and launching a high-altitude balloon. See [the Bristol SEDS website](http://www.bristol-seds.co.uk) for more information.
- I've also worked in Earth Sciences, in Bristol, and Surrey Space Centre.
